# HomeFieldAdvantage
CSI 4999 Senior Capstone Project

Home Field Advantage, at a base level, is a website that will allow end-users to leverage machine learning to predict the results of the upcoming Super Bowl within a confidence interval. It is our desire to utilize every aspect of the Computer Science and IT curricula to this point, including, but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Creating a lightweight Machine Learning model that predicts championship sports game results.</li>
<li>Storing the website and data in a cloud-based environment</li>
<li>Scraping  data from an online API into a database</li>
<li>Cleaning the data, analyzing it, and feeding it to the ML algorithm</li>
  <li>Presenting the results on the website</li>
</ul>
Tech stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end, Python for the back end, API call, data parsing and ML algorithm, SQL for database queries.
